## What is an URL shortener?

An URL shortener allows you to turn long and unreadable links into short and memorable links.

Simply enter the long link into the form and press the SHORTEN URL button.

On the next page you can copy the shortened URL and share it to your hearts content!

## Configuring the application to run in your environment

1. Open your CLI with NPM installed and change the directory to the project folder

2. Run "npm i" (node_modules have been added to .gitignore)

3. Open server.js and change the Mongoose connection string to connect to your desired database and make the application listen on your desired port

4. Run "npm start" in your CLI to launch the application
